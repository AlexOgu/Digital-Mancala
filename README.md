# Mancala
 The Mancala Game Simulator is a Python-based, two-player implementation of the classic game with ASCII-rendered boards. Players take turns moving stones, with real-time board updates and automatic winner detection based on Mancala counts. It features interactive gameplay and plans for future enhancements like AI, a graphical interface, and game-saving options.
